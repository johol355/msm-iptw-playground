    "\n",
    "If $Z$ is a set of variables that completely explain the confounding, then we have conditional exchangeability given $Z$. I.e. within levels of $Z$ the observation of treatment groups $A$ and their respective outcomes can be used to easily calculate the potential outcomes. Imagine a situation with only binary confounds, treatments and outcomes. To calculate the treatment effect we need to calculate the outcomes if all individuals recieved treatment or not, within groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, in group $Z=0$ we need to calculate the number of successes/failures if all 40 did get the treatment. Since 0.7 of the treated see success, we would end up with another 7 successes and three failures. We get this exact result if we just multiply the number of successes/failures in the treatment group by multiplying the inverse probability of receiving treatment within this strata of $Z$! The same is applied to group $Z=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='iptw1.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The same logic applies when calculating the outcomes had all individuals not been treated:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='iptw2.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we now add up the weighted populations of treated and untreated, we end up with a \"pseudopopulation\". One can see that it is larger (n=200) and that the probabilty of treatment is equal between groups. (Note: there could of course remain differences in treatment effect across groups, but this is true for randomized experiments as well!)\n",
